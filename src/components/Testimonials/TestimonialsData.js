    review: "Delicious food, beautifully presented, and with a wonderfully friendly staff. The owner and waitresses were absolutely lovely, contributing to a delightful atmosphere. I ordered a crepe, a mille-feuille, and a Ferrero Rocher milkshake, and they were all scrumptious! I would highly recommend paying a visit to this hidden gem, conveniently located just around the corner from Selfridges.",

    review: "I was out in London to celebrate a friend's birthday while doing some shopping on Oxford Street. We decided to take a break and enjoy some coffee and cake, and that's when we stumbled upon Kula. I have to say, the cinnamon pastry I ordered was absolutely heavenly. They even warmed it up, which made it even more delightful. The pastries are quite generous in size, so one could easily be shared between two people. Five of us had hot drinks, and three of us indulged in pastries, and the total bill came to Â£27.00, which I found to be very reasonable for London. I highly recommend paying them a visit.",

    review: "The cafe also offers a wide variety of juices, coffees, smoothies, and more. We tried various breakfast options from the menu, including the full English breakfast, pancakes with fresh fruits and Nutella, omelettes, and avocado toast with poached eggs. Everything was delicious.",
