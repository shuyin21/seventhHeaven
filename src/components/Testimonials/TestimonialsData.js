The owner and waitresses were absolutely lovely, and contributed to a very nice atmosphere ðŸ™‚ Ordered a crepe, muille fille & a Ferrero Roche milkshake~ and it was all delicious! Iâ€™d definitely recommend a visit to this little gem~ just around the corner from Selfridges",

    review: "Out in London to celebrate a friend's birthday with shopping on Oxford Street. We decided to stop and have coffee and cake and came across Kula. I must say the cinnamon pastry that I had was to die for. They warmed it up which made it even nicer. The pastryâ€™s are fairly big though so could have had one between two. Five of us had a hot drink and three of us had a pastry and it came to 27.00 which I thought was very reasonable for London. I would highly recommend a visit",

    review: "The cafe also offers a vide variety of juices, coffees, smoothies and more. We tried many different breakfasts from the menu. Such as full English breakfast, pancakes with fresh fruits and Nutella, omelettes and avocado toast with poached eggs. All was very good.",
